## My notes for the different task - Put this in the Program 3 clone

### Task 1 and 2

### Task 3: Density
```python
# Copy dataframe

# Create a new col with Actual number of people by race

# Races columns are in already percent value: 0.2 means 0.2%, 12.3 = 12.3%

# Aggregate by state

# May use the idxmax() to find the max state, use 'State' for the column

# return a tuple: state, max_population

# Cast to int at the end
```

### Task 4: Unemployment rate

```python
# Copy dataframe
# Make a new column TotalPop * Unemployment/100

# Aggregate by State

# For 'highest' get idxmax()
# For 'lowest' get idxmin()

# return tuple: state, rate
```

### Task 5: Income Inequality
```python
# Copy dataframe
# Filter records based Income and Poverty

# return DataFrame, with correct filter_records and columns
```

### Task 6: Feminine Pop.
```python
# Copy dataframe
# Filter records based on Population and Women

# return DataFrame, with correct filter_records and columns
```

### Task 7: Diverse Racially
